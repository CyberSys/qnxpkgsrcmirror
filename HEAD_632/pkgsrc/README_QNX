Most of the following applies if you're building.

- set umask 0022 (or put up with a lot of warnings)
- compile and install new 'patch' utility from HEAD.
  The shipped one doesn't do anything.  PR 21085.
- Install libtermcap with fix for PR 45283.
- compile and install new 'expr' utility with fix for
  PR 49169 and PR 50882.
  - 49169
    - libtool can hit this one when building gettext-lib
      package.  Later packages can complain about undefined
      references for symbols in libiconv so it's not
      immediately obvious what the issue is.
  - 50882
    - configure scripts can tickle this one of passed
      large arguments: eg LDFLAGS=.......
- compile and install new 'uname' utility with fix for
  PR 44076.
- compile and install 'comm' utility.  PR 19760.
  - perl needs this one.
- compile and install new 'ftp' utility from services/net/io-pkt/utils/f/ftp
  - Needs to link against services/net/io-pkt/lib/nbutil
- Run a proc with the fix for PR 44407: if you're
  pre trinity 2, this probably means you'll have
  to compile and run the HEAD.
- Compile and install a /bin/pwd with the fix for PR 44519
- Compile and install a /usr/bin/tr with the fix for PR 24740
- Your 'default' compiler will be used.  3.3.5 works much
  better:
# qcc -V 3.3.5,gcc_ntox86 -set-default
- Add /usr/pkg/bin:/usr/pkg/sbin to your PATH.
- Add /usr/pkg/lib to your CS_LIBPATH.

# cd pkgsrc/bootstrap
# ./bootstrap

- Add the following line to /usr/pkg/etc/mk.conf:
PKGSRC_COMPILER=qcc
- You might also want to add the following line to
  /usr/pkg/etc/mk.conf:
PKG_DEFAULT_OPTIONS+= -x11
  otherwise some packages will try to bring in x11
  support.  Alternatively you can disable it on a
  per package basis as per the following example:
# cd textproc/groff
# bmake PKG_OPTIONS.groff=-x11


# cd ../misc/figlet
# bmake install
# pkg_info
